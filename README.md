Requirements
Create a simple angular application that displays a list of items. The items should be loaded from an API (any public API) and the user should be able to sort and filter the items.
Note: For the design framework, you can use the latest version of either Bootstrap + ng-bootstrap (or) Angular Material. Basic styling of the page is expected but there is no need to get too creative.
